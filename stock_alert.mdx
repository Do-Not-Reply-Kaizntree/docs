## What are Low Stock Alerts?

Low Stock Alerts are alerts that appear on your Home Dashboard, in the “Low Stock Alert” table that alert you on stock levels that have reached a certain level you deem too low. Typically these are the re-order points. Low Stock alerts are individual to each item to ensure a maximum level of precision.

You also have “Desired Stock Alerts”. These indicate the level at which you’d like to keep your stock counts. When a stock count goes under that level, you’ll get notified, and this will give you time to reorder the product to make sure you don’t go under the low stock point.

## There are 2 ways for you to set these up:

If you know exactly what stock levels you’d want to maintain for each item, you can manually input the low stock alert levels either individually or in bulk directly from the item dashboard.

For Bulk editing, simply go to Item Dashboard \> select all items to be edited \> Bulk Edit.

For Individual editing, simply go to Item Dashboard \> Item Profile Page \> Edit

Alternatively, you can also decide to use Kaizntree’s proprietary formula to determine the optimal low stock alerts. These alerts are calculated based on your sales velocity and your desired days of stock on hand. For this, simply go into your Account Settings \> Kaizntree OS \> Inventory Management \> toggle on “Minimum Stock by Days on Hand” and input how many days you want of stock on hand.
