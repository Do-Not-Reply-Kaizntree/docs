        **What does the Shopify integration do?**

        Kaizntree acts as a **two-way data bridge** with Shopify. It automatically pulls in all your essential sales and product data while pushing key updates back to Shopify, eliminating the need for manual entry.

            **Overview**

            Kaizntree acts as a two-way data bridge with Shopify, handling both data extraction and (pull) and data submission (push). It simplifies your life and reduces to 0 manual data entry as all essential info is passed along in one way or the other. Some info is not passed from Kaizntree to Shopify to maintain your data privacy (such as costs).

            **Data Pulling**

            Kaizntree is configured to automatically retrieve key data from Shopify. This includes:

            - Sales Orders:

                - Name
                - Quantity
